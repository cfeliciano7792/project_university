## Project Overview
Project State University is an educational institution responsible for thousands of students. In order for this university, which makes millions of dollars in tuition yearly, to effectively manage its affairs, a database management system is required. Critical university tasks include maintaining student and instructor information, department level information, such as salaries and budgets, and course offerings. The database we will generate will enable this, along with other advantages listed below:

  1. The above base of information enables the university to easily add new courses, students, and faculty. The other benefit of recording this information is to allow the university to track which students are registered for which courses, thereby enabling faculty to do roster planning.
  2. Perhaps most important to these students is the ability to assign overall grade point averages based on the number of courses taken and the corresponding weight of those courses.
The above layout of the database is dynamic enough to allow for the insertion of new data without breaking the existing system. This system is also designed by two education professionals.

## Code Citations and Inspiration

We make generous use of code provided by Danielle Safonte and the Course Designers of CS 340: Introduction to Databases. In alignment with the [Code Citation Tips]([url](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1967354/pages/code-citation-tips?module_item_id=24460771)) we will describe how and where we utilized that code. As noted in the preceding hyperlink, "Whether you are copying or adapting code from a small snippet or using an entire module or function, you must cite your source."

The two areas of our code which draw on provided course material are the HBS (handlebars) files and the app.js files. We diligently followed the code the CS 340 starter code in those instances. The specific links to those pages in Canvas are [Exploration - Developing in Node.JS](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1967354/pages/exploration-developing-in-node-dot-js?module_item_id=24460848) and [Exploration - Overview of the Web Application Development Process](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1967354/pages/exploration-overview-of-the-web-application-development-process?module_item_id=24460846). 

However, as noted in the Code Citation Tips page, we would like to highlight our original work. We are extremely proud of our DDL and DML SQL queries, along with additional work we did to design a coherent and functional database. It is our firm belief that through a combination of diligent self-learning and well documented course materials like the Developing in Node page, that we have been able to put together our website.
